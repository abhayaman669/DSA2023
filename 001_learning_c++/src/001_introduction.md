# Introdution to C++

- C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language.
- It was developed by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/) at [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) starting in 1979.
- C++ is an extension of the C programming language, adding features such as classes, objects, and exceptions.
- C++ is a **statically-typed language**, meaning that the type of a variable is determined during compilation
- C++ builds upon the features of C, and thus, most C programs can be compiled and run with a C++ compiler.
- C++ is designed to provide high performance and efficiency. It offers fine-grained control over system resources, making it easier to optimize your software.

## C vs C++

| C | C++ |
|---|-----|
|C is a procedural programming language. | C++ is both procedural and object-oriented.|
| Focuses on functions and structured programming. | Supports both functions and classes.|
| Does not support objects or classes. | Incorporates different programming paradigms. |
| Memory management is manual, using functions like `malloc` and `free`. | Memory management can be manual (like C) or rely on constructors/destructors and smart pointers. |
