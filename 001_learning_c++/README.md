# Learning C++

The goal of this module is to get yourself familierize with c++ language.

## Why C++?

here is the answer from the blog post by scaler on [dsa roadmap](https://www.scaler.com/topics/dsa-roadmap/).
> Choose the language of either C++ or Java. Although Python can also be chosen, it is a good programming language, but it is not good for Data Structures and Algorithms. Many companies do not allow candidates to use Python because of its high time complexity. It is slower than both C++ and Java.

## What's the plan?

We will follow the roadmap from [C++ Developer](https://roadmap.sh/cpp).
